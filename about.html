<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is joudi. I'm 18 years old. I am a student in Udmy for web development with Dr. Angela Yu
  I have been to many many countries but i was born in Syria. My ethnicity is mixed. I'm half Egyptian , half syrian.
  I was raised in Saudi arabia and came to the states when i was 16 years old.
</p>

<p>I wanna make new websites and learn more and more everyday about web development. Ever since I took this course it has been life changing.
  All i wanna do is code and program websites and hopefully soon enough have my own very websites.
  Even though life in the states have been devastating for me, because i left all my friends and family behind.
</p>

<p>Alot of hardships faced me. I have been trying to go into university but no university would accept me
   and i would have a waiting list for a year to wait for acceptance. Which never made sense to me to wait this long
   to study so i started taking a lot of courses.</p>


<p>None of them would be as intresting to me as web development and i think i found myself in this course.
   All my family wanted me in the medical field but i would always think that comuters and websites were more intresting.
   When i told my parents that this would be my final decision. My father was very supportive of my decision. My mother
   on the other hand would say that this wouldn't be a good major to go into and study but i thought diffrently and did it
   anyways. I'm glad i took this step and i finally can call myself a web developer and would love to help people to make websites.
